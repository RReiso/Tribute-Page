					<p>
						Word Algebra is derived from the Arabic word <em>aljabr</em> found
						in the title of al-Khwarizmi's great book on mathematics
						<em>“Aljabar wal Muqabla”</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Al-Khwarizmi introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals to the West through
						his work <em>Algoritmi de numero Indorum</em> (“Al-Khwarizmi
						Concerning the Hindu Art of Reckoning”). From the name of the
						author, rendered in Latin as Algoritmi, originated the term
						<em>algorithm</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Binary Mathematics used in computer programming is based on the
						algorithmic modules developed by Al-Khwarizmi.
					</p>
					<p>
						Al-Khwarizmi wrote on all branches of mathematics: arithmetic,
						algebra, geometry and trigonometry. He also wrote on astronomy,
						geography, history, music, and astronomical instruments.

					<p>
						Abu Jafar Muhammad Ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi was born in 180 AH/795 AD
						in Khwarizm, which is now known as Khiva in Uzbekistan in Central
						Asia. He was known As Al-Khwarizmi as he was born in the town of
						Khwarizm.
					</p>
					<p>
						His ancestors were of Iranian origin who had settled in Khwarizmi
						long before his birth.
					</p>
					<p>
						He studied Indian, Greek and Islamic resources on mathematics and
						astronomy available during his time. He was also well versed in
						history and geography.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the completion of his studies, he joined the great Scientific
						Academy <em>Bait Al-Hikmah</em> (House of Wisdom) in Baghdad when he
						was twenty years old. He spent all his life in Baghdad, working for
						the science academy, studying mathematics and other subjects, and
						writing books.
					</p>
					<p>He died in 232 AH/847 AD in Baghdad.</p>

					<p>
						Al-Khwarizmi's most important book is
						<em>Kitab al Mukhtasar fil hisab al-jabr Wal-Muqabla</em> (Book of
						calculation by restoration and balancing) Topics discussed in the
						book include the basics of algebra; six standards forms of algebraic
						problems, formulae for their solutions; addition, subtraction,
						multiplication, division; areas of a triangle, circle, square; the
						volume of cones, pyramids and cubes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Al-Khwarizimi said that algebra is based on the two processes -
						<em>aljabr</em> and <em>al muqabala</em>. Aljabr (restoration) is
						the process of transferring the negative quantity to the other side
						of the equation and eliminating it while Al Muqabala (balancing) is
						uniting the similar quantities from other sides of the equation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another major book was his <em>Kitab surat al-ard</em> (“The Image
						of the Earth”; translated as Geography), which presented the
						coordinates of localities in the known world based, ultimately, on
						those in the Geography of Ptolemy (flourished 127–145 CE) but with
						improved values for the length of the Mediterranean Sea and the
						location of cities in Asia and Africa.
					</p>
					<p>
						Al-Khwarizmi also compiled a set of astronomical tables, based on a
						variety of Hindu and Greek sources. This work included a table of
						sines, evidently for a circle of radius 150 units.
